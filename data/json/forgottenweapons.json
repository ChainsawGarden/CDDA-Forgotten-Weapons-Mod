One-hundred of these were commissioned by U.S. Continential Army General George Washington in 1777, but the order was cancelled only a few days later due to the outrageous amount of money the inventor asked for. It was considered an \"extraordinary allowance\", and it seems that the British Army thought so, too. And thus, the rifle was never put on the field. This one is likely one of an extremely few number of models in existence.",
